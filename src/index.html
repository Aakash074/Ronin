						</header> 
						<h3>US National Champions!</h3>
						<p>AeroFlow Racing was a team of five seniors (left to right: Arul Gupta, Ayush Goyal, Michael Jin, Shivam Patel, and Poojan Mehta) from the Wheeler Center for Advanced Studies in Marietta, GA that competed in the 2018 World Finals in Singapore. Their team had a drive to learn from their mistakes,
							improve their team unity, and progress to achieve the impossible. Through their experience at the 2018 United States National Competition, they built a multitude of connections related to various aspects of the competition, developed a vast platform
							for communication and team branding, and understood the actions necessary to succeed at the world finals. AeroFlow Racing: one team, with one goal, with one passion.</p>

				<p>F1 in Schools is a worldwide competition consisting of several teams made up of kids aged 9-19. In this vastly competitive league, teams of 3-6 develop cars utilizing CAD and other related tools. However, the complexity of what we do reaches beyond
					mere engineering and into fields of business/marketing, graphic design, and possibly most importantly if considering real-world application, team management and cooperation. Then, each of these skill sets developed throughout the team process is
					put to the test at regional, national, and world level competitions. As a result, F1 in Schools has created a system which effectively develops and enhances students’ learning experience through their interests as well as by teaching necessary real-world
					situations/applications.
